## Repository Overview

This repo contains small Windows-focused PowerShell utilities designed to be triggered from Elgato Stream Deck.

- Main scripts:
  - [Copy-SelectedPath.ps1](mdc:Copy-SelectedPath.ps1): Copies path(s) of selected items in Windows Explorer to the clipboard, with joining and quoting options.
  - [Start-ChatGPT-Voice.ps1](mdc:Start-ChatGPT-Voice.ps1): Opens ChatGPT in a browser and triggers Windows Voice Typing (Win+H).

### How scripts are invoked
- Intended execution: `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File <script>` from a Stream Deck “Open” action.
- Scripts are safe to run interactively for testing without Stream Deck.

### Expected environment
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5+ or PowerShell 7.
- Windows Explorer for selection-based features and `Shell.Application` COM.
- Browsers: `msedge.exe` or `chrome.exe` in PATH for app-mode launch; otherwise default handler.

### Quickstart and usage
Refer to [README.md](mdc:README.md) for step-by-step setup, examples, and troubleshooting notes.
